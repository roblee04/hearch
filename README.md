Heavy modifications were made.

--> more crawling capabilites

Depth - How many layers of links to crawl through. You must set at least a depth of 1 if you want to crawl any hyperlinks. Setting a negative value = no limit. Be careful about that.

Pages - How many pages to crawl on each link layer (depth). They will be randomly selected. You must set at least 1 if you want to crawl any hyperlinks. Setting a negative value = no limit. Be careful about that.

Type - Indicates if you want to only crawl links local to the website, or links external to the website, or both.
